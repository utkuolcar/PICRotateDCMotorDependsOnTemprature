# PICRotateDCMotorDependsOnTemprature

This is the undergraduate course project that is programmed via MikroC Pro and this project rotates a dc motor depending 
the data that is coming from ds18b20 onewire digital temprature sensor. 

I worked with PIC16F887 and 4 mhz crystal. I will share the circuit shematic in a short time.
